# 🎓 Student Grade Tracker (Java)

This is my first fully self-coded Java project, developed during my internship at **CodeAlpha**.  
It is a simple and beginner-friendly console application that helps track student names and their marks.

This project represents the starting point of my Java development journey, where I learned how to apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in a real project.

## 🚀 Features

- Add student details  
- Store and retrieve student marks  
- Display all student records  
- Search for a student  
- Clean and structured Java code using OOP  
- Uses `ArrayList` for dynamic data storage

## 🧠 What I Learned

While building this project independently, I practiced:

- Creating classes and objects  
- Using constructors and getter methods  
- Working with `ArrayList`  
- Handling user input with `Scanner`  
- Designing a simple menu-driven Java program  
- Writing clean, readable, and modular code

## ✔ Future Improvements

I plan to upgrade this project by adding:

- File handling (store student data permanently)  
- GPA / grade calculation  
- Sorting students by marks  
- GUI version using JavaFX or Swing

## 🙌 Acknowledgement

This project was created during my internship at **CodeAlpha**.  
Even though it's simple, it marks the first step in my journey as a Java developer.  
More projects coming soon as I continue improving my skills 🚀
